This document outlines the steps required to run the Inventory Management System program in PyCharm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- PyCharm: Install PyCharm, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python development. You can download it from [jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

## Steps to Run

Follow these steps to run the Inventory Management System program:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Inventory Management System repository from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Open Project in PyCharm**: Open PyCharm and select "Open" from the welcome screen. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project folder to open it in PyCharm.

3. **Set Up Interpreter**: Configure a Python interpreter for the project if not already set. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Project: <project_name>` > `Python Interpreter`, and select a Python interpreter from the dropdown list. If no interpreter is listed, click on the gear icon and add a new interpreter.

4. **Install Dependencies**: If the project requires any external dependencies, such as libraries or packages, install them using pip. Open the terminal in PyCharm and run the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Program**: Once the project is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the program. Locate the main Python file (e.g., `main.py` or `app.py`) in the project directory and open it. Then, right-click anywhere in the editor window and select "Run <filename>".

6. **Follow Program Instructions**: Depending on the program's design, you may need to follow on-screen instructions, such as providing input or interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI).

7. **View Output**: After running the program, you can view the output in the PyCharm console or any other output windows specified by the program.

8. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any errors or issues while running the program, refer to the error messages displayed in the console or output windows. You may need to debug the code or make adjustments to resolve any issues.

That's it! You have successfully run the Inventory Management System program in PyCharm. You can now explore its features and functionality as needed.
